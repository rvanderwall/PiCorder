# Case
Several choices for a case were looked at.
The Playmate case was just a bit too small.
I choice the Diamond Select (a.k.aArt Asylum) for price (about $100 on eBay) and size.
It looks like it's nearly identical to the one used on set.
The Master Replica (MR) one was expensive ($500) and I really couldn't find one readily.

Also, the Wand company is making a replica that looks like it will be amazing!

But, it's too nice to tear down for the case.
