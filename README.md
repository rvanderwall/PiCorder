# Case
Several choices for a case were looked at.
The Playmate case was just a bit too small.
I choice the Diamond Select (a.k.aArt Asylum) for price (about $100 on eBay) and size.
It looks like it's nearly identical to the one used on set.
The Master Replica (MR) one was expensive ($500) and I really couldn't find one readily.
The Marko ProBuilt, while rare, would work as well.  it's aluminum construction is much nicer than the plastic in the DS. 

Also, the Wand company is making a replica that looks like it will be amazing!

But, it's too nice to tear down for the case.
