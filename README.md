# Case
Several choices for a case were looked at.
- The Playmate case was just a bit too small.
- I chose the Diamond Select (a.k.aArt Asylum) for price (about $100 on eBay) and size.
- It looks like it's nearly identical to the one used on set.
- The Master Replica (MR) one was expensive ($500) and I really couldn't find one readily.
- The Marko ProBuilt, while rare, would work as well.  It's aluminum construction is much nicer than the plastic in the DS. 

- Also, the Wand company is making a replica that looks like it will be amazing!

- But, it's too nice to tear down for the case.
